My name is Amber Lee, I work in security, used to own a gym, and have a love/hate relationship with the Internet of Things. You can see my reviews of fitness devices and Apps at [BreakingMuscle.com](http://breakingmuscle.com/coaches/amber-lee)

My professional history can be found on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/amberleelee)

You can reach me at [info@secure-lee.com](mailto:info@secure-lee.com)

I'm using Jekyll to generate this page, and host it on GitHub because it looked nifty and because I can! You can find more information about Jekyll at [www.jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)
